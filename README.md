# DNSparse

Playing around with parsing dns packets in Javascript.

## ToDo
- [x] Import packet string into Arraybuffer
- [x] Parse the headers into a Javascript object
- [x] Test/Fix browser JS compatibility

To see the parsed result of the packet, clone the repo and :

```npm install && npm run```

To view in the browser, open `index.html` in your browser and look at the console output.

The raw packet that is parsed has also been saved as `./data.udp.bin`, if you would like to look at it to parse it some other way.
